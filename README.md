# üìò Book Management REST API using Node.js and Express

A simple REST API to perform CRUD operations on a list of books. This API uses in-memory storage (no database required) and is tested using Postman.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Postman for testing API
- Code Editor (VS Code preferred)

### Setup

1. Initialize the project:

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm i express
    ```

3. Save the code from [`server.js`](server.js) in your project directory.

4. Start the server:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    or
    ```bash
